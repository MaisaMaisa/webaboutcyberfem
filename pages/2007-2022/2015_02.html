        <p>**What did GamerGate + WikiHarassment teach us?</p>
        <p>**That there are third-part trolls who will release private information just to watch chaos that ensues (thru doxxing or SWATing)</p>
        <p>**Doxxing = practice of releasing private information of a person (home address, phone number, place of employment, contact info of relatives) on a site like PASTEBIN and direct people there to harass the targeted person</p>
        <p>**Pastebin = text storage site; add text through chat</p>
        <p>**Doxxing escalated to SWATing (using your doxxed info to place a fake threatening call of mass violence to local police so that they show up with SWAT and violently occupy your residence)</p>
