        <h1>Why Siri Sounds Like A Girl, But Says She Beyond Gender by Katy Gero on SheCanCode</h1>
        <a class="website" href="https://www.shecancode.io/blog/why-siri-sounds-like-a-girl-but-says-she-is-beyond-gender" target="_blank">https://www.shecancode.io/blog/why-siri-sounds-like-a-girl-but-says-she-is-beyond-gender</a>
        <p><i>All our digital assistants are women, or at least women sounding. With such consistency across the board, there must be some good reasoning behind it. After all, artificial intelligence is just a reflection of ourselves.</i></p>
        <p>**blog post</p>
        <p>**Asked Siri “What’s you gender?” And Siri said SHE IS BEYOND HER HUMAN CONCEPT OF GENDER</p>
        <p>**Not only Siri is a woman sounding machine, but Alexa, Cortana, and others..WHY?</p>
        <p>**It can’t be because women are easier to understand.</p>
        <p><i>Then it's done: Siri is a woman because it's what we want. We probably want Siri to be a woman because as a society we view women as helpful and supportive nurturers who will do what we want and ask nothing in return—the perfect assistant. Think teachers, think secretaries, think nurses, think mothers. Think women called aggressive when men would be called assertive. It's a depressing truth that none of the technology giants of our day will step up and set the default voice to be male—Google Now doesn't even have a male voice option—but perhaps it's our own fault. Like all A.I., digital assistants are a reflection of ourselves.</i></p>
