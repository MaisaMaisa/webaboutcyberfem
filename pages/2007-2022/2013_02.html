        <h1>Hashtag Feminism by Tara L. Conley</h1>
        <a class="website" href="https://www.hashtagfeminism.com/" target="_blank">https://www.hashtagfeminism.com/</a>
        <p>**project of love born out of love for internet culture + passion for social justice</p>
        <p>**It was Tara’s third year of grad school</p>
        <p>**Digital platform that “collects receipts” on Twitter</p>
        <p>**Functions to reflect the culture and politics of the hashtag activism era</p>
        <p>**The website was hacked</p>
        <p>**Revived by a Columbia professor and his students who hosted a #Feminism hack-a-thon to try and help retrieve some of the content</p>
        <p>**But the original was gone</p>
