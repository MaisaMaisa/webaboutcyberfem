        <p>**Baidu became the main search engine when Google left China</p>
        <p>**Bai = hundred; Du = degrees</p>
        <p>**Younger gens may think that google copied Baidu</p>
        <p>**Miao Ying (artist) found a poem online called: “The thirty degrees of your smile cannot be found online” - by a boyfriend looking for a picture of his gf’s smile on Instagram but the website was blocked</p>
        <p>**She visualised the scenario in a gif (include)</p>
