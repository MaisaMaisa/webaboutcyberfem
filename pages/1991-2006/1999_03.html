        <h1>GESTURING TOWARD THE VISUAL: VIRTUAL REALITY, HYPERTEXT AND EMBODIED FEMINIST CRITICISM - Carolyn Guertin</h1>
        <!-- <a class="website" href="https://www.thing.net/~bindigrl/" target="_blank">https://www.thing.net/~bindigrl/</a> -->
        <p>“Interactivity is not, however, the same thing as agency. Janet Murray argues that agency is born, not of interactivity as such, but through the act of spatial navigation within a text or an environment (Murray 128-129). In interactive environments, we construct the text as we read  with our choices forming the contours of the space of our reading. A form of criticism that embodies agency as a native mode is essential to exploring feminist issues in women’s art.”</p>
        <p>**Technical interactivity vs. feeling of freedom online</p>
        <p>**Is software enabling you to do something <i>more</i> with it freedom or the opposite??</p>
        <p>**Successful freedom while using software = making the software limited from the beginning</p>
