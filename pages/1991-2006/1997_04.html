            if anything in the exhibit moves them, i wish they'd write to this stranger why and how and what happens in their life.
            i wish to have a tape of the opening.
            i wish to know your responses to the possible questions.
            and i know that i haven't answered your questions.
            in fact, here my approach has been so selfish that i've only verbalized my attention to a one-way relay, like in an admission application.</i></p>
