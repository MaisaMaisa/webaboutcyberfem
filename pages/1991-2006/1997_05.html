        <p>**MY FAV BOOK EVER</p>
        <p>**women's natural relationship with modern technology (it will trigger a new sexual revolution)</p>
        <p>**One of the arguments: computers re-write old conceptions of a man and his world</p>
        <p>**One of the arguments: Women are rooted in telecommunications technologies (always an object in communication)</p>
        <p>**my fav quote:</p>
        <p>
            <i>The zeros and ones of machine code seem to offer themselves as perfect symbols of the orders of Western reality, the ancient logical codes which make the difference between on and off, right and left, light and dark, form and matter, mind and body, white and black, good and evil, right and wrong, life and death, something and nothing, this and that, here and there, inside and out, active and passive, true and false, yes and no, sanity and madness, health and sickness, up and down, sense and nonsense, west and east, north and south. And they made a lovely couple when it came to sex. Man and woman, male and female, masculine and feminine: one and zero looked just right, made for each other: 1, the definite, upright line; and 0, the diagram of nothing at all: penis and vagina, thing and hole. . . hand in glove. A perfect match.</i> — Sadie Plant, Zeros and Ones

        <p>**Now it becomes clear</p>
        <p>**Statistics: 77% percent of internet’s usage by men = 3 men per 1 woman online</p>
        <p>**In science fiction, William Gibson + Pat Cadigan begin to imagine characters with male-gendered attributes to depict post-gender society; only Terry Mixon imagines cyborgs as human + machine (multiple split subjects = transcend gender)</p>
