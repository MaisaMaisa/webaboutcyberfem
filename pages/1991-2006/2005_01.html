        <p>**server run by women</p>
        <p>So this is our own space to practice being systems administrators,Â where peers are present to answer questions and show by example.

            The server looks like a 'pizza box' packed in a type of bookcase along with a whole lot of other similar servers. The server hotel, or hosting centre is in Phoenix, USA.
            
            We meet on an IRC channel to talk shop. Then one by one take on a task that needs to be done or learnt. The women are from all over the world: Vancouver, Philadelphia, Rotterdam.</p>
