        <h1>Women Hackers - Cornelia Sollfrank</h1>

        <p>**Writing about female hacker scene in the US, but also failing to find any women.</p>
        <p>**Not only was it hard to find them in the commercial scene, but also underground/alternative</p>
        <p>**Women's preference: work in the cultural environment, engaging in political work, and IF POSSIBLE non-technologically</p>
        <p>**BUT CAN AESTHETIC/CULTURAL PRACTICE ALONE AFFECT TECHNO-DEVELOPMENT?</p>

        <br><br>
        <p>**These questions are some sort of encouragement to get our hands dirty with technology</p>
        <p>**Also a question of on-going battle between praxis and theory</p>
        <p>My additional argument(2022): even when we get our hands dirty, we are pushed to work on the aesthetics/ surfaces (front-end web development vs back-end web development)</p>
