        <p>'digi gender social body' - socially constructed online body as a site of potential violence??, control??, liberation??</p>
        <p><i>"The project began with two articles that Cheang read in the Village Voice. One told the story of Brandon Teena (December 12, 1972–December 31, 1993), a young Nebraska trans man who was brutalized and murdered. The other, Julian Dibbell's "A Rape in Cyberspace," described a rape spree that took place in a text-only chat room, and nevertheless left its victims feeling violated and bereft. Drawing a connection between these very different episodes of violence, Cheang began a years-long research process to "consider gender fusion and techno-body in bouth public space and cyberspace.”</i></p>

                Why was BRANDON restored in 2016-2017?<br>

                BRANDON was programmed between 1997 and 1999 and used then-current web technologies such as Java applets, CGI scripts (written in Perl), JavaScript, HTML, and PHP. Almost two decades later, some of these technologies are no longer supported by contemporary browsers, and parts of BRANDON had become corrupted or inaccessible. Before the restoration, BRANDON's many Java applets that animate text and images were not displaying properly; font types, sizes and colors were not interpreted correctly; links were broken; the Mooplay interface was inoperable and the virtual court records were not accessible through the Theatrum Anatomicum interface.

        <p>**In science fiction, William Gibson + Pat Cadigan begin to imagine characters with male-gendered attributes to depict post-gender society; only Terry Mixon imagines cyborgs as human + machine (multiple split subjects = transcend gender)</p>
