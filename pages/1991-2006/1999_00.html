        <p><i>Bindi is my avatar. Not only is she my alias in the virtual world but a play on the word which in India means an incarnation of a Hindu deity, the embodiment of an archetype. In this case she is the embodiment of the "goddess/whore" archetype which has historically been used to simplify the identity of women and their roles of power in society.</i></p>
        <p>**Both technology and religion have failed her</p>

        <p>**She thinks about religion and technology as same</p>
        <p><i>PM: Technology like religion was invented to help us cope with or liberate us from our daily existence in a physical world - to make it better somehow and bring us to higher levels of functioning. But we as humans have "bugs" in our system that keep us from moving on to the next level. Therefore our code (in both culture and computers) is erred. It is not technology itself, or religion for that matter, that has failed Bindi, but those people who use them as a means to keep in place existing structures that reject diversity and a sharing of power.</i></p>
        <p>**I like to think about that today; there is a lot of techno cynicism claiming that the internet has failed us and if you're not cynical about the internet/technologies than you're a techno-optimist/should go to Sillicon Valley and so on...<br>It's interesting to think about the answers while having religion/faith bubbling above my head. <br>Who bought the promise of internet freeing us? (From beginning of my usage, I thought of it as a tool)</p>
