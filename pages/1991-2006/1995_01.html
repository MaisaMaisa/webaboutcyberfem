        <p>**Work of art made of 'monsters' made body parts donated by 30 women</p>
        <p>**at Adelaide Festival</p>
        <p>**Scanned body parts in combo with recorded sound</p>
        <p>**The monsters were made clickable</p>
        <p>**Unexpected things would follow (the words attached to that body part could be heard or seen, another monster may appear, a digital video could play, a story or biological information about the physical state described by the story, may be displayed)</p>
        <p>(look at them)</p>
