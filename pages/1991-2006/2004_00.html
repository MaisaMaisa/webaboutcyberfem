        <p>**a book about the hacker culture, but also vectoralist class (those who want to own the information)</p>
        <p>**WHAT IS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY? Who own it? <b>Who releases it?</b></p>
        <p>**At that time, a whole new kind of class conflict</p>

        <p>**Fav quotes:</p>

        <p><i>'Where the capitalist class sees education as a means to an end, the vectoralist class sees it as an end in itself. It sees opportunities to make education a profitable industry in its own right, based on the securing of intellectual property as a form of private property. To the vectoralists, education, like culture, is just “content” for commodification.'</i></p>
        <p><i>‘All abstractions are abstractions of nature. To abstract is to express the virtuality of nature, to make known some instance of its manifold possibilities, to actualise a relation out of infinite relationality. Abstractions release the potential of physical matter. And yet abstraction relies on something that has an independent existence to physical matter—information. Information is no less real than physical matter, and is dependent on it for its existence.’</i> — McKenzie Wark, A Hacker’s Manifesto</p>
