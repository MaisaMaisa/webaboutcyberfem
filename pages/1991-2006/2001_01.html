        <h1>The Politics of ‘Cyberfeminism’ in the Middle East: The Case of Kurdish Women - Shahrzad Mojab</h1>
        <p>**Context: real world political struggle: real world activism vs. Virtual activism </p>
        <p>**How to use internet to advance feminist studies + activism among non-Kurdish women </p>
        <p>**Reality: majority of activists = Kurdish women; majority of researchers = from west </p>

        <p><i>“While no state can politically deter us from engaging in such activities, economic imperatives act as powerful deterrents. Very simply, these projects do not feed us, and do not pay our rent and bills. We need either adequate financial resources or a strong and popular feminist movement.”</i></p>
        <p>**What was mentioned before (males working in the technical field and females in cultural) - this gives another complexity amongst women</p>
