        <p>skinonskinonskin (1999) is a series of digital love letters sent between artists Auriea Harvey and Michaël Samyn.</p>
        <p>The two artists met in 1999, and began a romance by exchanging interactive web pages, in Flash, audio, text, and images. Originally sharing their “letters” solely with one another, Harvey and Samyn later made them available to paid subscribers as an online artwork. skinonskinonskin is now out from behind its paywall and available on the public web for its launch as part of Net Art Anthology.</p>
        <p>As their relationship grew, Harvey merged her web practice, Entropy8, with Samyn’s Zuper! to create the collaborative entity Entropy8Zuper!. In skinonskinonskin, artistic collaboration and love are shown to be closely related, two facets of the same fundamental question of how to relate to the other. The work is a complex portrait of an artistic and romantic relationship that shows that online intimacy is as deeply felt, embodied, and full of risk and reward as any other form.</p>
