        <h1>INFO HEAVY CYBER BABE (newsletter) - Julianna Pierce</h1>
        <p>**New definition of cyberfeminism</p>
        <p>**First version of it = FLAME, moment, a spam which became a hip (impulse that became a commodity)</p>
        <p>“The updated version of the cyber feminism is more about networking, webgrrrrls, geek girls, FACES, OBN, online publishing, career prospects, list servers and international conferences. It’s about Hybrid Workspace and the 100 anti-theses. It’s embracing diversity and difference, being opinionated, being loud and at times staying quiet. But the key to all of this is information, in the information society, to get ahead you must control the commodity. Information is political, it’s a weapon, and the more knowledge we have, the more powerful we are.”</p>
