        <h1>Stealing Glances: Women(‘s) Writing on the World Wide Web - Greg Dyer’s</h1>
        <a class="website" href="https://electronicbookreview.com/essay/stealing-glances-womens-writing-on-the-world-wide-web/" target="_blank">https://electronicbookreview.com/essay/stealing-glances-womens-writing-on-the-world-wide-web/</a>
        <p>** what is women’s writing? (Self cannot be detached from the writing)</p>
        <p>** these directory sites are communal graffiti walls</p>
        <p>** worries about self-publishing and publishing</p>
        <p>** women’s writing is defined by their self-publishing on the internet</p>
        <p><i>“As is true with most aspects of the Internet, the tension between the hope for a more truly democratic means of expression and debate and the reality of any bureaucracy that attempts to make such democracy effective is a real concern. Hopefully sites like Femina and Webgrrls will find a way to increase the ease with which women writing on the Web can be located, and will be able to do so in a manner that doesn't simply reconstruct the exclusionary aspects of print publication or weaken the sense of connection through installing a less tangible (than the printed book), but still more obvious sign of distance between reader and online identity.”</i></p>

        <p>MY QUESTION: kind of agree, there are so many newsletters and information curations. But for whom is this more important today? What groups of people still need to organise around sharing resources that are not given to them? </p>
