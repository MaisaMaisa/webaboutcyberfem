        <p>**Art work in response to the first in the world competition for net art by Kunsthalle (Hamburg Art Museum)</p>
        <p>**She made 300 fake female artists (remixed exiting webs to create data trash) and registered them to the competition) making 2thirds of participating</p>
        <p>**3 prizes went to men, ofc</p>

        <p><i>I consider FEMALE EXTENSION as a typical example for CYBERFEMINISM. The term CYBERFEMINISM describes a group of artists, activists and theorists that started to meet the male dominance in cyberspace in an unusual fashion in the last couple of years. We use the potential of the term CYBERFEMINISM that arises from its contradictory and undefined nature. These contradictions didn't develop out of the fusion of CYBER and FEMINISM, but are already inherent in the two terms. The fusion of these two terms creates additional confusion. An important strategy of CYBERFEMINISM is the use of irony. Irony is about humor and seriousness. Only with irony can the contradictory views can be joined. All these diverse approaches are necessary and important and create a productive tension. That's why CYBERFEMINISM is not just a rhetorical strategy, but also a political method.</i></p>
        <p><i>A new concept of politics is needed. The methods of earlier decades don't work anymore. An expanded concept of politics has to contain the possibility of both paradox and utopia. It has to be in opposition, able to argue from different perspectives at the same time, and at the same time make meaningful political action possible. A concept of politics that simulates politics, while being politically effective at the same time. With this concept of politics, once again, we approach art.</i></p>

        <p>**Now it becomes clear</p>
        <p>**Statistics: 77% percent of internetâ€™s usage by men = 3 men per 1 woman online</p>
        <p>**In science fiction, William Gibson + Pat Cadigan begin to imagine characters with male-gendered attributes to depict post-gender society; only Terry Mixon imagines cyborgs as human + machine (multiple split subjects = transcend gender)</p>
