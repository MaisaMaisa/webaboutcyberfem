        <p>**I.K.U. is a porn film that takes up where Blade Runner(1982) left off</p>
        <p>**lack of narrative, despite characters having identity and goals</p>
        <p>**it was meant to feel like internet (visual text that merges porn and sci-fi, film/video + computer)</p>
        <p>**characters interact</p>
        <p><i>Shu Lea Cheang's I.K.U. (subtitled This is not LOVE. This is SEX.) invents a future cybersexual universe, where trained replicants roam the empty spaces of unseen metropolises, hunting willing prey for orgasmic sexual marathons conducted in the service of science. The irresistible replicants are equipped with unicorn-like arms which – presto – turn into dildo machines specifically calibrated to collect and transmit the specifications of orgasms into the centralized, corporatized databases of the future. Meanwhile, the species of the future are wildly indeterminate, gender-blurred or homosex, oversexed or just, well, willing. Shorn of emotion, sex isn't just work. Data has its pleasures, too.</i></p>

    <div class="meanwhile">
        <p>**more non-linear storytelling movements in arts and media</p>
        <p>**also theoretically more determination that the term will not be further defined for clearer understanding because it means many things to many people</p>
