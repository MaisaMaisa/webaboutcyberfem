        <p>**Artists from Barcelona</p>
        <p>**exhibitionists approach - documented + published everything on the website (now is immediate practice)</p>
        <p>**Another porn is possible + sexuality = it should be pleasant</p>
        <p>**sex should not be a commercial pursuit</p>
        <p>**workshops with theoretical approach, discussions, more queer perspective + practice = filming each other, making their own porn</p>

        <p><i>We have a name that’s a joke – girlswholikeporno. Girls who like porno, how amusing. But what’s so amusing about it? What’s so amusing in affirming that there are women who like pornography? True, the porno industry has done a lot of harm – an industry full of stereotypes and sexist cliches that has left its mark on us, an industry whose absolute banality has made us loathe it. The term pornography has been contaminated to the extreme. But pornography can be something else. And it is in our hands that it be something else. In our hands and in our cameras. Because if we don’t like what we see, we can film something different. Do it yourself.</i></p>

        <p>**1995 = 15% women online</p>
        <p>**2000 = 50%</p>
        <p>**Men still controlled the content and earned profit of it</p>
        <p>**more questions about ownership of the internet (considering we are all immigrants in cyberspace) — extremely relevant to think of today in web3 — what does it mean to claim territory in cyberspace?</p>
