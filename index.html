        <p>This book is a gathered material of women’s placement in the history of technology that the author collected (as a designer and a gatherer). The collection begins from year 1991 and ends in 2020. Based on the title, one may think that the answer to what is cyberfeminism will become clear, but the chunky index only proves how complex its, if there is one, definition is. In fact, the index (its design) shows how impossible to offer one definition of it, as women have, throughout the history, negated taking the position of coining the term. The book ends with the same question: What is cyberfeminism? And it is everything that this index collects in order to show a different kind of cyberspace: collaborations, activisms, solidarities, aids to survive, mainly shaped by women.</p>
        <p>This source is useful for getting a whole different image of the internet quick. No project or reference in it is longer than two paragraphs, which at times, also makes them seem repetitive, but only proves how hard it is to make a shift in the pattern(especially if you’re a woman, black, mother, unemployed, etc).</p>
